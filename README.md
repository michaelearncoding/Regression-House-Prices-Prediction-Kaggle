# Regression-House-Prices-Prediction-Kaggle

Hi, this is a Kaggle competition based project, which:
- The goal of the competition is to predict the final price of each house in a test dataset, based on 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes
- The evaluation metric is the root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) between the predicted and the actual sale prices
- The competition is open to anyone who wants to practice their data science skills and learn from other participants

In this project, I :

- Applied advanced regression techniques such as Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, and XGBoost to predict house prices based on 79 features. Transforming amounts of categorical features for XGboost and LabelEncoding by understanding Business Logic.

- Used bagging ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models and improve the accuracy and robustness of the results. Ranked Top 10% solution out of 6,000+ participants in the Kaggle competition, with a root mean squared logarithmic error (RMSLE) of 0.1019.
